- The inputs files, that have a parametrization (_e.g._ meshes, solver parametrization, etc...)
- The output files (_e.g._ post processed errors, measures, time measurments, etc...)


== Set up the configuration of `feelpp.benchmarking`

NOTE: A complete documentation of the tool `feelpp.benchamrking` can be found online https://bench.feelpp.org/benchmarking/index.html

=== The configuration to run the study

Create a first JSON file with the following entries :

- `executable`: the path to the executable that is going to be benchmarked
